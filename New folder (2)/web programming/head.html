That beautiful head of yours holds a lot more than you can imagine. O2 Spa specializes in the best head massages to make you feel relaxed and relieve your brain from stress.
When you look at your head, all you can see is just a mop of hair (or lack of there) and your scalp. What this part of your body is holding inside is more important than you think. Your brain, a clump of thousands of nerves and their functioning. While it’s impossible to massage the “brain”, O2 Spa’s expertly trained professional therapists can massage the skull by putting the right amount of pressure with finger tips.
