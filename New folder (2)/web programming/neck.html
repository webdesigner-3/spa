If your back feels sore and tired and you experience a sharp pain in the movement of your neck and back, it probably means that your back and neck are experiencing a lot of strain and stress. This massage is especially recommended for those who are suffering from back and neck pain.
The Neck and back massage usually involves our expert therapists gliding their hands on your neck and back, and squeezing, gentle thumping, kneading and many more techniques to unblock the knots inside your muscles and boost blood circulation.
O2 Spa offers a varied range of back and neck massages to relieve the pain and help you feel amazing during and after the massage.
