<p>Waxing services are traditionally one of the best ways to make the hair removal process easier. Women prefer waxing over other options of hair removal because of the long-lasting effect. Which is why, waxing, for women around the world has become the ultimate match to remove unwanted hair.
Waxing is a procedure where the raw wax is melted in a heating-jar and is applied on the area of the skin, where excess hair exists. After applying the wax, a strip of soft paper is applied to pull the wax from the applied area in the opposite direction of the hair growth. This pulls the hair right from its follicle, leaving space for soft and smooth skin.
At O2 Spa, we use the safest wax that is gentle on your skin but effective to remove the unwanted hair in just one simple pull. The unique technology in our wax makes it less painful for you and ultimately hindering the hair growth for months! Book your waxing service appointment now!.</p>
